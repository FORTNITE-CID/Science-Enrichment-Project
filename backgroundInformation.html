    <h3>Diseases</h3>
    <p>A disease is anything that causes something or someone's body to change.</p>

    <h3>Pathogen</h3>
    <p>A pathogen is anything, living or non-living, that causes disease. There are 4 types of pathogens.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bacteria</li>
      <li>Viruses</li>
      <li>Fungi</li>
      <li>Paracites</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Bacteria</h3>
    <p>A bacteria is a uni-cellular prokaryote, which means that it doesn't have organized DNA and organelles. Bacteria can be good and bad, some help you and some can cause disease. They usually reproduce asexually and they reproduce very fast.</p>

    <h3>Viruses</h3>
    <p>A virus is literally a bunch of DNA in a protein coat. Viruses are usually called non-living because they don't have any of the machinery to reproduce. The way that viruses reproduce is through infecting a host cell, injecting DNA inside the host cell, and then the host cell with start making copies of the virus. There is another way that viruses can reproduce. The way I talked about earlier is called the lytic cycle. The other type is the Lysogenic cycle. The lysogenic cycle is when the virus injects its DNA into the host and the host makes the viruses' DNA a part of its own. This is especially dangerous if it turns lytic. All the cells that are infected turn on randomly one day and start making the virus. This can become life threatening.</p>
